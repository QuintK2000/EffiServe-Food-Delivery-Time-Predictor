This project aimed to improve operational efficiency in the food delivery industry by providing reliable estimates of when the food will be delivered.  The development process encompassed essential steps such as data cleaning, feature engineering, Label Encoding, and Standardization to ensure the data was appropriately prepared. We further conducted a thorough comparison of various regression algorithms(linear regression, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost) using Cross Validation to identify the best model for the food delivery dataset. Evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score were used to assess the model's accuracy, XGBoost was selected for its robust performance, achieving an R-squared score of 0.82. This prediction model empowers businesses to optimize their operations and improve the overall delivery experience for their customers.
